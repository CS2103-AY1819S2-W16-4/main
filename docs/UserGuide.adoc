*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [skill/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[skill/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `skill/Java`, `skill/Excel skill/leadership` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

// end::add[]

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all candidates in Recruit Me. If there is a filtering available, it lists all the persons that passes all the filtering conditions. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing candidate in Recruit Me. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [d/EDUCATION] [g/GPA] [deg/DEGREE-LEVEL] [a/ADDRESS] [skill/TAG]... [position/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative, both skills and positions will be changed after editing one of them) except for
existing endorsement tags.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `skill/` or `position/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower skill/` +

// tag::filter[]
=== Filtering Recruit Me: `filter`

* It filters the current applicant pool regarding the existing entities of every single person (name, phone, email, address, gpa, education (school), degree level, position, endorsement count or skills). +
* *Format:* `filter or/and [name<NAME>name] [phone<PHONE>phone] [email<EMAIL>email] [gpa<GPA>gpa] [edu<EDUCATION>edu] [deg<DEGREE-LEVEL>deg] [addr<ADDRESS>addr] [skill<SKILL1, SKILL2, ... >skill][pos<POSITION1, POSITION2, ... >pos] [end<ENDORSEMENT>end]`

[TIP]
For every field, using `< or >` can cause false results. Please do not use them in filtering criterion texts. All the fields are optional but at least one field should be used.

****

*Definition of Some Keywords for the Filter Guide:*

* *Prefix:* basically the beginning part of every field in the command e.g. `name<` for NAME field, `deg<` for DEGREE-LEVEL.
* *Reverse Prefix:* the ending part of every field in the command e.g. `>name` for NAME field, `>deg` for DEGREE-LEVEL.
* *Condition:* The text between every `Prefix` and `Reverse Prefix` couple.

*Different Types of Filtering Processes:*

* `OR` Usage: According to the conditions written, if at least one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.
* `AND` Usage: According to the conditions written, if every single one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.

*Special Input Conditions for Fields:*

* For all the non-mentioned fields below, the default input format should be applied for the filtering field. Default input formats can be checked from `Adding a person: add - User Guide`
* For `PHONE`, any number of integers more than 0 can be entered.
* For `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS`, any number of ASCII characters (also take the `TIP` into attention for correct results) more than 0 can be used.
* For `GPA`, it prints the persons who have higher or equal amount of GPA from the given input
* For `ENDORSEMENT`, a positive integer value is wanted, it prints the persons who have that much or higher amount of endorsements.
* For `SKILLS` and `POSITIONS`, if more than one specification are added to the filter, they should be separated by ','
* For `DEGREE-LEVEL`, there are 2 input type options: text and number. For the text format, the search is *case-insensitive*. So, any uppercase or lowercase type of the text is accepted.
If filtering is applied for this criteria, the persons with the same or higher education levels are shown. There 5 different levels for the input:
** *Number:* `0` and *Text:* `highschool`
** *Number:* `1` and *Text:* `associates` (2-year-university)
** *Number:* `2` and *Text:* `bachelors`
** *Number:* `3` and *Text:* `masters`
** *Number:* `4` and *Text:* `phd`

*About the Running Process of Filtering Command:*

* The filtering is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* Filtering does not check if the written condition passes totally. It only checks, if the written condition is contained in the person properties.
e.g if there is someone named Alex, in the filtering conditions `n/ale/n` or `n/le/n` or `n/lex/n`, Alex will be included.
* All the people that are included in the filtering will be returned.
* `ADD` operation clears the existing filters automatically.
* After one filtering, the filtered address book can be filtered again.
* For every single criteria between the filtering prefixes, input check for the validity is made.
* Filtering is compatible with all the other commands:
** 1- `clear` : since the persons list changes, the filtering is automatically cleared
** 2- `add` : when filtering is active, adding a person also clears the filter along the addition. But addition takes place.
** 3- `sort / endorse / select / delete / edit / list / undo / redo / help / exit / history` : can be used without clearing the filter

****

Examples:

* `filter or phone<91234567>phone email<mail@ex>email skill<C++, Java>skill end<2>end deg<4>deg`
** _Returns the people, whose numbers include `91234567` or whose email includes `mail@ex` or who has (contains) at least `C++ or Java` in the skills or has at least `2 endorsements` or has at least `Master's degree`._
* `filter and name<ale>name addr<street>addr gpa<3.1>gpa pos<Manager, Developer>pos deg<bachelors>deg`
** _Returns the people, whose name contains `ale` (in any uppercase and lowercase format) and whose address contains `street` and who is interested in `Manager and Developer` positions,has a GPA higher than or equal to `3.1` and has at least `Bachelor's degree`._

Format: `filter clear`
// end::filterclear[]

// tag::filterreverse[]
=== Reversing the filter in Recruit Me: `filter reverse`
It reverses all the filtering conditions and shows the eliminated ones. +
Format: `filter reverse`
// end::filterreverse[]

=== Approve persons by employee name: `endorse`

Endorses an existing candidate in RecruitMe. +
Format: `endorse [clear] INDEX n/YOUR NAME`

****
* Endorses the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* All ASCII characters accepted, not limited to alphanumeric
* Error will be thrown if an employee tries to endorse a candidate more than once
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative) except for
existing endorsement tags.
* Removes endorsement of a person at the specified index using `clear` keyword
* Error will be thrown if an employee tries to unendorse a candidate he or she has not previously endorsed

****

Examples:

* `endorse 1 n/Steve Jobs`
Adds a blue tag to the candidate at the `1` index with the text `Steve Jobs`
* `endorse clear 1 n/Steve Jobs`
Removes 'Steve Jobs' blue tag from the candidate at the `1` index


=== Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* It filters the list of candidates temporally. If you use `filter` or `sort` commands after that, they uses the entire list to process. To have a permanent filtering until you use `add` command or clear the filter, use the `filter` command.
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

****

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

=== Sorting persons: `sort`

Sorts persons by method described by the given keywords. +
Format: `sort [reverse] KEYWORD`

Accepted KEYWORDs:
        `name`; `surname`; `education`; `gpa`; `skills`; `positions`; `endorsements`; `skill number`;  +
        `position number`;  `endorsement number`

Examples:

* `sort education` +
Returns the persons, with new index numbers, in alphabetical order of their education.
* `sort reverse skills` +
Returns the persons, with new index numbers, in reverse alphabetical order of their first skill. Their first +
skill is that which appears first when the person's skills have been ordered alphabetically.

Methodology:
****
* The `sort name` command compares the Christian name first and then the surname. +
_e.g. `Adam Smith` shall come before `Shaun Adams` and `Adam Blacksmith` shall come before `Adam Smith`._
* The `sort surname` command compares the surname only. +
If two surnames match, then the previous relative ordering of the two shall be kept. +
_e.g. `Ben Adams` shall come before `Adam Black`._
* The `sort education` command sorts the persons by the alphabetical ordering of their education (case-insensitive). +
_e.g. `Charlotte Green (NTU)` shall come before `Adam Smith (NUS)`._
* The `sort gpa` command sorts the persons by increasing gpa numeric value. +
_e.g. `Adam Smith (3.1)` shall come before `Charlotte Green (3.9)`._
* The `sort skills` arranges each person's skills alphabetically and then arranges the people based on their skills in alphabetical order (case-insensitive). +
_e.g. `Peter Parker (Python, Debugging)` shall come before `Charlotte Oliveiro (Java)` +
since `Debugging` comes before `Java`._
* The `sort positions` arranges each person's positions alphabetically and then arranges the people based on their positions in alphabetical order. +
_e.g. `Charlotte Oliveiro (Project Consultant, Crime Analyst)` shall come before `Peter Parker (Databases)` +
since `Crime Analyst` comes before `Databases`._
* The `sort endorsements` arranges each person's endorsements alphabetically and then arranges the people based on their endorsements in alphabetical order (case-insensitive). +
_e.g. `Irfan Ibrahim (Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos)` shall come before `Alex Yeoh (Mark Cuban, Steve Jobs)` +
since `Jeff Bezos` comes before `Mark Cuban`._
* The `sort skill number` arranges persons based on the number of skills they have from most to fewest.+
_e.g. `Peter Parker (Python, Debugging)` shall come before `Charlotte Oliveiro (Java)` +
since `Peter Parker` has two skills where as `Charlotte Oliveiro` only has one._
* The `sort position number` arranges persons based on the number of positions they have from most to fewest.+
_e.g. `Charlotte Oliveiro (Project Consultant, Crime Analyst)` shall come before `Peter Parker (Databases)` +
since `Charlotte Oliveiro` has had two positions where as `Peter Parker` only has one._
* The `sort endorsement number` arranges persons based on the number of endorsements they have from most to fewest. +
_e.g. `Irfan Ibrahim (Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos)` shall come before `Bruce Wayne (Thomas Wayne)` +
since `Irfan Ibrahim` has two endorsements where as `Bruce Wayne` only has one._
* The `reverse` keyword can be used in conjunction with any of the above keywords and it shall reverse the ordering. +
_e.g. The `sort reverse surname` command shall result in `Adam Black` coming before `Ben Adams`._
* If the sorting method has two persons with the same value _(e.g. both persons have two endorsements in the 'sort +
endorsement number' command)_, then the previous relative ordering of the two shall be kept.
* The `sort` command is compatible with the `filter` command. +
If the Address Book contains ten persons, but the filter has selected just three persons, then only the three persons shall be ordered and returned with the new index numbers. +
Additional filters can be applied within the sort.
* The `sort` command is partially compatible with the `find` command. +
If the Address Book is currently sorted according to a certain method, the `find` command shall return the persons, according to the specified find keyword, ordered by the previous sort method. +
If the Address Book has currently _found_ certain persons from the `find` command, an additional sort shall sort all those in the address book and not just those that have been _found_.
Should the user wish to just sort a few people, the `filter` command should be used as outlined above.
* The `sort` command is compatible with all other commands (add/clear/delete/edit/exit/help/history/list/redo/select/undo). +
It shall not automatically update the returned list of persons. For example adding a person shall simply add them to the end of the list of persons.
****
