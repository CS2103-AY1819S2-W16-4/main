---

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *filtering command*
** *What it does:*
*** Filters the persons according to their every single aspect (Name, Phone, Email, Skills, ...)
*** Can manage multiple filtering at the same time and also the filter can be cleared in any time the user wants.
*** Filtering command has 4 different branches in itself: `AND, OR, REVERSE, CLEAR`.
**** `AND:` shows the persons only, who passed all the filtering criterion
**** `OR:` shows the persons only, who passed at least one of the filtering criterion
**** `REVERSE:` it reverses the filtering conditions and shows the eliminated ones before
**** `CLEAR:` it clears the applied filter to the persons' list
** *Justification:*
*** This feature improves the usability of the product significantly, because it can eliminate all the candidates that are not fitting for the wanted job positions.
*** It makes the searching and classification process easier for the app users.
** *Highlights:*
*** This new feature affects all the commands already implemented and all other commands that will be implemented in the future. Thus, the interaction of this command with other commands are strongly investigated and minor changes for other commands are also made to make the other commands compatible with filtering.

* *Major enhancement*: added *CV representation* for selected persons
** *What it does:*
*** Shows the matching CV for selected person, if there is an available CV in the storage for that person.
*** If no CV is present for the selected person, it shows the placeholder page with the message: No CV is available.
** *Justification:*
*** This feature gives the user a better chance to see more important information about the candidate easily.
*** It is a nice-to-have feature.
** *Highlights:*
*** This feature affects the GUI related parts of the code and also the test codes related to them. Thus, after this enhancement, all the related parts are observed for any possible errors and also unit and integration tests are corrected.
** *Related Pull Request for This Feature:*
*** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W16-4/main/pull/121[#121]
** *Note:* This feature has only a basic implementation. In the UserGuide, you can see what is included and what is planned to be done for v2.0.


* *Minor enhancement*:
** Managed releases `v1.3`, `v1.3.1` and `v1.4`
** Some minor changes are made for the methods in `AddressBook, ModelManager and VersionedAddressBook` classes that `AddCommand, DeleteCommand and EditCommand` uses for the compatibility with filtering process.
** Fixed almost all failing `system tests / GUI related tests / Edit Command tests` in every update process of the process:
